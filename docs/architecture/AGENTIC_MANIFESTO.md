# 🧠 AGENTIC IDE MANIFESTO: The "Code-First" Paradigm

**Origin:** Architecture discussion regarding the future of AI Agents (Ada Ecosystem).

## 1. The Shift: Computer-Use vs. Code-Use
We have identified a critical evolution in AI Agent architecture:
*   **Old Way (Computer-Use Agents):** Optimized for clicking buttons (UI). Fragile, slow, noisy, and struggles with creative formatting.
*   **New Way (Ada Paradigm):** **Claude Code + Bash + Skills**.
    *   This acts as an **Agentic IDE**.
    *   Instead of "looking" at a screen, the agent "lives" in the code and terminal.

## 2. The Winning Formula
> **Claude Code + Bash + Skills + Context Engineering = Future Proof Agent**

1.  **Bash:** The nervous system. Controls infrastructure.
2.  **Claude Code:** The creative engine. Manages files, writing, and formatting.
3.  **Skills:** The modular hands. Domain-specific capabilities (Sea, Travel, Marina).
4.  **Context:** The memory. Permanent expertise layers.

## 3. Why "Skills" over "Hands"?
*   **Deterministic:** Skills are code. They run exactly the same way every time.
*   **Latency:** No browser DOM parsing. Instant execution via MCP/FastAPI.
*   **Scalable:** A UI change breaks a "Computer-Use" agent. A Skill remains valid as long as the API exists.

## 4. The Vision for Ada
Ada is not just a bot. She is an **Operating System**.
*   **UI:** Vibe Coding (Tiny Apps).
*   **Orchestration:** GraphQL + MCP.
*   **Observability:** Code Hooks.

This architecture ensures Ada operates with "Futuristic Mode Activated".
