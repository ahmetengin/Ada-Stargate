## 1. General Rules and Laws in Turkish Territorial Waters

All maritime activities in Turkey are regulated by international and national legislation.

*   **International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs):** These globally applicable rules regulate the right of way between vessels, navigation lights, and sound and visual signals. Every mariner must know and apply these rules.
*   **Ports Law No. 6093 and Related Regulations:** Regulates navigation, anchoring, berthing, and other activities within port areas. It is mandatory to comply with the instructions of harbor masters.
*   **Environmental Law:** Polluting the seas is strictly prohibited. Discharging bilge, garbage, sewage, and other waste into the sea is subject to severe penalties. Waste must be delivered to waste reception facilities at marinas.

## 2. Mandatory Documents to be Kept on Every Vessel

The essential documents required on a Turkish-flagged private vessel are:

2.  **Amateur Seaman's Certificate (ADB) or Higher Competency Certificate:** Mandatory for operating vessels larger than 2.5 meters and smaller than 24 meters. It is the captain's license.
3.  **Short Range Certificate (SRC) Operator's Certificate:** If the vessel has a fixed or handheld VHF radio, the operator must possess this certificate.
4.  **Mandatory Vessel Insurance:** The policy for insurance covering third-party liability at sea.

*   **Turkish Flag:** Every Turkish-flagged vessel must fly a clean and undamaged **Turkish Flag** on the stern staff or in the most prominent position.

## 5. Rules for Transiting the Turkish Straits (Istanbul and Çanakkale)

The Turkish Straits are subject to strict international and national rules. The basic rules for private vessels are:

*   **Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS):** Small vessels must navigate **outside** the lanes designated for large ships, keeping to the right side according to their direction of travel.
*   **VHF Radio Watch:** The relevant **Sector Channel** (e.g., Sector Marmara, Sector Kandilli for Istanbul / Sector Nara, Sector Gelibolu for Çanakkale) must be monitored continuously throughout the transit. Vessel traffic announcements are made on these channels.
*   **Right of Way:** Ships proceeding within the traffic separation scheme have the right of way. Small vessels must keep clear of their path.
*   **Currents:** Currents are very strong, especially in the Bosphorus Strait. The passage plan should account for this.
*   **Reporting:** Vessels over a certain length may be required to report to Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) before and during transit.

## 6. Traveling to the Greek Islands: Rules and Requirements

Entering Greece by private vessel is the same as entering any country and requires official procedures.

### 6.1. Required Documents

2.  **Port Police (Limenarcheio):** First, visit the Port Police. Present passports, vessel documents, and the crew list.
3.  **Transit Log (DEKPA or similar document):** The Port Police will issue a **Transit Log**, which allows the vessel to cruise freely in Greek waters. This document must remain on board until departure from Greece.
